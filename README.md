# Time-series-prediction-LSTM
Neural networks such as long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks can almost perfectly simulate the problem of multiple input variables

This is a great advantage in time series prediction. The classical linear method is difficult to adapt to multivariate or multi input prediction problems.

In this work, you will learn how to develop an LSTM model for multivariate time series prediction in the keras deep learning library.
